# 🎓 Git Gud

This repository is where you will learn how to **actually** use git effectively as part of a team. This project is designed for people who are completely new to git and know basically nothing about what it is, how to use it.

This course will offer you no meaningful certification of your skills other than the fact that you can do more than fat finger your keyboard.
